Constructor Reference is used to refer to a constructor without instantiating the named class.

The Constructor reference mechanism is yet another game changing addition by Java 8. 
You can pass references to constructors as arguments or assign to a target type. 
Similar to method references, you can refer previously defined constructors and assign to a target type of a Functional Interface.
